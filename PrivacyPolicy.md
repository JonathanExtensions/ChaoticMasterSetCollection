Chaotic Collection Master Set: Privacy policy

This is an iOS app developed by myself, Jonathan.

As an avid iphone user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. Which is why I wanted both a) the app to be fully functional offline, once downloaded all resources for the app are in the app. b) I wanted to create an app that has no ads, always will be free, and has no bloatware or tracking, or permissions needed. Just a clean app with images to keep track of your collection.

Data collected by the app (There isn't any) I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either. This was done as a passion project for the community of this now dead card game for 15 years.


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Jonathan Florida, United States appstcg@gmail.com
